After a \\nU.S. drone strike killed a top general in 2020, Iranian air defenses mistakenly shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane, killing all 176 people on board.', 'Meanwhile, attacks by the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels continue in the Red Sea, most recently targeting a U.S. warship. The missile launched Tuesday night targeted the USS Gravely, an Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer, the U.S. military’s Central Command said in a statement. No injuries or damage were reported.', 'A Houthi military spokesman, Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement Wednesday morning, calling it “a victory for the oppression of the Palestinian people and a response to the American-British aggression against our country.”', 'Saree claimed \\nthe Houthis fired “several” missiles, something not acknowledged by the U.S. Navy. Houthi claims have been exaggerated in the past, and their missiles sometimes crash on land and fail to reach their targets.', 'The Houthis claimed without evidence on Monday to have targeted the USS Lewis B. Puller, a floating landing base used by the Navy SEALs and others. The U.S. said there had been no attack.', 'On Wednesday, a U.S. military jet struck a surface-to-air missile that was about to launch from Houthi-controlled Yemen, a U.S. official said. The missile was deemed an immediate threat and destroyed. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details ahead of a public announcement.', 'Since November, the rebels have repeatedly targeted ships in the Red Sea over \\nIsrael’s offensive against Hamas in Gaza. But they have frequently targeted vessels with tenuous or no clear links to Israel, imperiling shipping in \\na key route for global trade between Asia, the Mideast and Europe.', 'The Houthis hit a commercial vessel with a missile on Friday, \\nsparking a fire that burned for hours.', 'The U.S. and the United Kingdom have launched multiple rounds of airstrikes targeting the Houthis as allied warships patrol the waterways affected by the attacks. The European Union also plans to \\nlaunch a naval mission in the Red Sea within three weeks to help defend cargo ships against the Houthi attacks, the bloc’s top diplomat said Wednesday.']})])"

Nikki Haley, who trails far behind Trump in the Republican primary. The poll found Haley would do better than Trump in a general election, with 47 percent of respondents supporting Haley and 42 percent supporting Biden.', 'Haley’s support comes largely from independents, with 53 percent saying they’d vote for her.

In the same poll, 52 percent of independents said they’d support Biden over Trump, who’d have the support of 40 percent of respondents.', '“In a head-to-head matchup against Biden, Haley outperforms Trump, thanks to independents,” Malloy said. “Add third party candidates to the mix and her numbers slip in part because of her weakness among Republicans.”', 'The poll surveyed 1,650 self-identified registered voters nationwide from Jan. 25 to 29, with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 2.4 percentage points.
